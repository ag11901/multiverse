# VibeWave: Ship a Track, Get a Synth

**Created by:** @Aritro Ghosh at Hack Club

## üåü Elevator Pitch  
Make an original electronic music track (1.5-2.5 minutes) and receive your very own pocket synthesizer!

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works  
Participants create electronic music using any tool they want - code-based music generators like Sonic Pi, traditional software like GarageBand or Audacity, or online platforms like Waveform Zyklop. Submit your finished track (MP3/WAV) with a brief description of how you made it and evidence of the samples used. Every completed submission receives one of several pocket synthesizers (Korg Monotron Duo, Stylophone, Stylophone Beat Box, or Synth-a-Sette).

## üéÆ How It Plays
Participants will embark on an 8-10 hour music creation journey, starting with sample collection from royalty-free libraries or their own recordings. They'll learn to manipulate these samples using envelope controllers (ADSR), filters, and various synth modulation techniques like LFOs and pitch shifting. Weekly challenges will introduce participants to different aspects of electronic music production ‚Äì perhaps "Weird Texture Tuesday" or "Bassy Beat Friday" ‚Äì creating community momentum.

Participants will engage through scheduled Discord listening sessions where they can share works-in-progress and receive feedback from peers. Special guest sessions with electronic musicians could provide inspiration and technical tips. The final week focuses on mixing, mastering, and polishing their tracks before submission. Once approved, tracks join the official Hack Club Electro playlist on Spotify, giving participants legitimate streaming presence on a major platform.

Beyond shipped music, participants gain foundational knowledge of digital audio workstations, understanding of sound design principles, and experience with the creative process from conception to publication. The community aspect builds connections between technically-minded and artistically-minded students who might not otherwise collaborate.

## üöÄ The Development Plan  
I'll work solo on this project, dividing it into two phases. During the first half, I'll coordinate the music production aspects similarly to how "Juice" is currently run at Hack Club. This includes creating instructional resources, organizing the weekly challenges, and facilitating community feedback sessions.

For the second half, I'll focus on the operational aspects: coordinating synthesizer shipping logistics, building an AI tool to scan submissions for originality (ensuring tracks aren't just remixes of existing music), and working with Spotify to create the official playlist. I'll leverage Hack Club's existing infrastructure for shipping physical items while developing new systems specific to music distribution.

## üî• What Challenges Do You Anticipate?  
- Navigating Hack Club's existing project approval process, as this represents a new direction that combines both digital and physical elements
- Ensuring the AI originality checker doesn't unfairly flag legitimate techniques like sampling when used creatively and legally
- Balancing the program budget against Hack Club's other initiatives, especially given the physical hardware component
- Managing different time zones for synchronous listening sessions when Hack Clubbers participate globally
- Securing permission from parents/guardians for publishing minors' music on Spotify under Hack Club's account
- Addressing potential cultural differences in musical preferences across Hack Club's diverse global community

## üéØ What Do You Hope to Learn?  
As a Hack Club leader, I hope to gain experience merging technical and artistic communities within the organization, potentially creating a blueprint for cross-disciplinary projects which can expand Hack Club's reach to the computational aspects of other subjects with my skills in program management.

I'll gain practical knowledge about music publishing platforms and copyright considerations, which could be valuable for future Hack Club creative initiatives. Building the AI originality verification tool will enhance my machine learning skills while serving a practical purpose. Most importantly, I'll learn how to create pathways for students who may not initially identify as "technical" to engage with Hack Club through their artistic interests, potentially widening our community's diversity and impact.
